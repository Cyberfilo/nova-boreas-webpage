            <h2>🏎️ What's STEM Racing?</h2>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>
                    STEM Racing is an educational program supported by Formula 1 that uses motorsport to make science,
                    technology, engineering, and math more exciting. Students are challenged to design, build, and race
                    miniature Formula 1 cars, turning classroom learning into a real-world experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working in teams, students take on roles like engineers, designers, and project managers, just like
                    in a real F1 team. They use professional software to create 3D models, test performance, and
                    manufacture their cars before racing them on the track.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond engineering, STEM Racing helps students develop teamwork, creativity, and communication
                    skills. By mixing technical knowledge with business and presentation skills, the program prepares
                    young people to solve problems and think innovatively about the future.

                Sponsoring Nova Boreas means supporting a dedicated team of students from the same school competing in
                the international STEM Racing competition. The challenge pushes students to design, build, and race
                high-performance model cars while developing real-world skills in engineering, innovation, and teamwork.
                By sponsoring Nova Boreas, you directly invest in young talent and practical STEM education within our
                school community.
