                    STEM Racing is an educational initiative designed to inspire students through the excitement of
                    motorsport. Supported by Formula 1, the program introduces young people to the world of science,
                    technology, engineering, and mathematics by challenging them to design, build, and race miniature
                    Formula 1 cars.

                    Spanning age ranges of 9 to 19 our main objective is to help change the perceptions of science,
                    technology, engineering and maths by creating a fun and exciting learning environment for young
                    people to develop an informed view about careers in engineering, Formula 1, science, marketing and
                    technology.
                    STEM RACING Ltd is a social enterprise working with committed industry partners to provide an
                    exciting yet challenging educational experience through the magnetic appeal of Formula 1. STEM
                    RACING is the only truly global educational programme that raises awareness of STEM and Formula 1
                    among students and school children in every region, in every country, on every continent.

                    Offering a way to learn Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) related subjects in such
                    an exciting way is achieving great results and we know we are increasing the intake of students into
                    Engineering careers. We are privileged to have the support of the Formula 1 community – in
                    particular Mr Stefano Domenicali and, of course, the Formula 1 teams who make our students welcome
                    in the F1 paddock and in their factories.
                    There are many success stories who have actually come through our initiative and have gone on to
                    achieve significant outcomes in their lives including positions in Formula 1 teams.
                    As STEM RACING moves into the future we will continue to expand into more and more countries. This
                    is largest and most successful school based STEM program in the world and we will continue to grow
